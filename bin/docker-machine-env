# Set the docker-machine environment
#
# normally you have to eval the output of docker-machine env to set the
# docker environment variables. To automate this I write the commands to
# a file and source it. The sourced variables only apply to the context of this
# script, so you have to prefix it with '. '
#
#
# USAGE:
#
#   $ . docker-machine-env {machine_name}
#   # => sets the current env vars to the docker machine
#


docker-machine env ${1} >> /tmp/setdockerenv

source /tmp/setdockerenv

rm /tmp/setdockerenv
